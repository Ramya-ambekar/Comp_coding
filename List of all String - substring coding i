1. Find All Substrings: Given a string, find all possible substrings of it.

2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.

3. Smallest Window in a String Containing All Characters of Another String: Given two strings, find the smallest window in the first string that contains all characters of the second string.

4. Longest Palindromic Substring: Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

5. Substring with Concatenation of All Words: Given a string and a list of words, find all starting indices of substring(s) in the string that is a concatenation of each word in the list exactly once.

6. Minimum Window Substring: Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S that will contain all the characters in T.

7. Valid Palindrome: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

8. Implement strStr(): Implement strStr() to find the index of the first occurrence of one string (needle) within another (haystack).

9. Group Anagrams: Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

10. Find Permutation: Given a string and a pattern, find all anagrams of the pattern in the given string.

11. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most K distinct characters.

12. Valid Parentheses: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

13. Count and Say: Given an integer n, generate the nth count-and-say sequence.

14. Repeating Substring Pattern: Given a non-empty string, check if it can be constructed by repeating a substring of itself.

15. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters: Find the length of the longest substring of a given string that contains at least k repeating characters.
